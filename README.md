# Object Tracker using CamShift

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the CamShift algorithm to track objects in video using OpenCV and Python. The CamShift (Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift) algorithm is an extension of the Mean Shift algorithm, which is used for locating the maxima of a density function. It's particularly useful for tracking objects in video sequences.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library with GUI support

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-tracker-camshift.git
   cd object-tracker-camshift
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   - For webcam input:
     ```bash
     python track.py
     ```
   - For a video file:
     ```bash
     python track.py --video path/to/video.mp4
     ```

2. Press the `i` key to enter ROI selection mode.
3. Click four points around the object you want to track.
4. Press any key to exit ROI selection mode and start tracking.
5. Press `q` to quit the program.

## How It Works
The script uses the CamShift algorithm to track objects in video. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the steps involved:

1. **ROI Selection**: The user selects a Region of Interest (ROI) by clicking four points around the object they want to track.
2. **Histogram Calculation**: A color histogram of the selected ROI is computed using the Hue and Saturation channels of the HSV color space.
3. **Back Projection**: The histogram is used to create a back projection of the current frame, highlighting areas that match the ROI's color distribution.
4. **CamShift Tracking**: The CamShift algorithm is applied to the back projection to estimate the position, size, and orientation of the tracked object.
5. **Display Results**: The estimated bounding box is drawn on the video frame and displayed.

## Limitations
- **Color Histogram Dependency**: The CamShift algorithm relies heavily on the color histogram of the ROI. If the object's appearance changes significantly (e.g., due to lighting or occlusion), tracking may fail.
- **Single Channel (Hue)**: The script uses only the Hue channel of the HSV color space. For better results, consider extending it to use both Hue and Saturation channels.
- **No Advanced Tracking Features**: CamShift is a simple algorithm and may struggle with complex scenarios. For more robust tracking, consider using modern algorithms like KCF, CSRT, or MIL.
